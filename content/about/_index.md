## Who Am I?

### School

I'm a computer science student at 42, a school in France. Currently, I'm learning C and will soon be learning C++.

### Side Projects

I'm learning website creation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's been a great experience so far. I'm also heavily into shell scripting, which helps me automate tedious tasks.

In addition, I have an interest in online privacy and may create a YouTube channel about it in the future. This website may be my first step in that direction.

## How to Contact Me

### At School

If you have any questions about my code or anything I publish here, feel free to stop by and see me. I welcome constructive feedback on what I've done and how I can improve.

### GitHub

If you have suggestions or ideas on how to improve my work, you can create an issue in the relevant repository.

### Email

For longer messages or inquiries, you can email me. My email address can be found on the homepage. This should only be used for important matters.
